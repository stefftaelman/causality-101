    "Collider bias, also called selection bias, is still very prominent in research (e.g., [Griffith *et al.*, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19478-2)), creating significant correlations where there should be none. An often cited example is the apparent negative correlation between actor's looks and their acting skills. If we only look at (*select*) successfull actors, we'll find some that have become popular by their looks and other by their acting prowess. Because only a smaller fraction will be both, we'll observe a negative correlation between the looks and acting skills in this group."
