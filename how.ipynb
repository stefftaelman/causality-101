    "When statisticians talk about bias, adjustment is often the go-to solution. When you have a **low dimensional dataset**, *i.e.*, you only have a limited number of features, it is often possible to adjust for confounding variables. This is done by either stratifying (taking the average of the effects X on Y over each of the confounding groups) or by including the confounder variable in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are interested in the effect of a gene expression on a survival rate, as in [Uhlen *et al.*, 2018](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2507?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), you might want to adjust for the age of the patient, as older patients are more likely to die sooner<sup>*</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>*</sup> Interestingly, Uhlen *et al.* did not adjust for age in their 2018 Science publication. A highly interesting critical review of their methods can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.994038v2).\n",
